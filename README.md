# dynamic_simulation_library
needs to be compiled to math_library and require math_library for multiplier and int18 types
VHDL library for synthesizable real-time simulation tools of dynamic systems.

Library is based on state-variable type that has integration method for simulating differential equations in real time on FPGA. Different applications include LCR filters and power electronics converters

There are also blog posts explaining the design of the state variable and the dynamic simulation models
